# burger-logging

Description: This project demonstrates the use of Heroku, handlebars, express and MySQL working together to produce a burger log. It allows the user to create a burger, then decide if they still need to eat the burger, have devoured it, or just delete the burger.

Install: In order to utilize this program the user will need to utilize the terminal to complete installs of mysql, express and express-handlebars via npm i. The user can either just enter in npm i or npm i mysql express express-handlebars into the terminal. Once the packages have installed, the user can then access it. This is also being deployed via Heroku.

Usage: For school purposes at this time, with further development it will be used on my portfolio.
